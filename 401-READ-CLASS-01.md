Do you want what comes at the end of this journey?

Yes 

Are you doing this for you?

## Beginners Guide to Big O

- Big O notation is used in Computer Science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm. 

- `O(1)` - algorithm that will always execute in the same time regardless of the size of the input data set.

- `O(N)` - algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set.

- `O(N2)`- algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set.

- `O(2N)` - algorithm whose growth doubles with each additon to the input data set. The growth curve of an O(2N) function is exponential.

### Logarithms

- `O(log N)` - algorithm that halves data sets looking for a target based on high or low of a median.
