## Whiteboard Interview

### Communicate

- The best piece of technical interview advice I have received and can impart upon you is to communicate, communicate, communicate! This may seem like an anti-climactic piece of advice, but I hope to be able to demonstrate to you that it’s actually the most important skill to prepare prior to an interview.

### First, Restate the Question

- Do you understand what they’re asking you to do? Prove it. Restate the question for them and seek affirmation. You might actually be surprised to find you don’t fully understand what they’re asking for — perhaps the question is similar, but not the same, as a practice problem you have completed in the past.

### Ask About Edge Cases

- It’s still not time to dive right into coding the solution. Think for a bit about the inputs and expected output and think about potential edge cases to the problem.

### Ask About Test Cases

- This is free and you should take advantage of it. Simply ask if there are any test cases that the function should pass.

## 6 Tips

1. Take a few minutes.
2. Write down the steps of the solution.
3. Write pseudocode first.
4. Don’t sweat the small stuff.
5. Sit down. Be humble.
6. Come prepared.
