## Docker

- Docker is a popular open-source project written in go and developed by Dotcloud (A PaaS Company). It is basically a container engine that uses the Linux Kernel features like namespaces and control groups to create containers on top of an operating system.

- Docker is really just Linux containers which are a type of virtualization.

### Containers vs Virtual Environments

- Virtual environments can only isolate Python packages. They still rely on a global, system-level installation of Python albeit they can refer to the proper version. So when we use Python 2.7 in a project, weâ€™re pointing to an installation of Python 2.7 on the computer itself, not actually within the virtual environment.

### Images and Containers

- Images and containers are the two fundamental concepts to grasp when you start with Docker. An image is a snapshot in time of what a project contains. A container is a running instance of the image.

## Library Website and API

- Django REST Framework works alongside the Django web framework to create web APIs. We cannot build a web API with only Django Rest Framework; it always must be added to a project after Django itself has been installed and configured.
