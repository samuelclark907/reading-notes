## What is Risk Analysis in Software Testing and how to perform it?

- In Software Testing, risk analysis is the process of identifying the risks in applications or software that you built and prioritizing them to test.

### Why use Risk Analysis?

- Highlights the potential problem areas.

- Helps the developers and managers to mitigate the risks.

### Possible Risks

- Use of new hardware

- Use of new technology

- Use of new automation tool

- The sequence of code

- Availability of test resources for the application

### Risk Identification

- Business Risks: This risk is the most common risk associated with our topic. It is the risk that may come from your company or your customer, not from your project.

- Testing Risks: You should be well acquainted with the platform you are working on, along with the software testing tools being used.

- Premature Release Risk: a fair amount of knowledge to analyze the risk associated with releasing unsatisfactory or untested software is required

- Software Risks: You should be well versed with the risks associated with the software development process.
