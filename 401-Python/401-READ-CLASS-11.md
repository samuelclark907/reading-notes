## JupyterLab

- JupyterLab is a next-generation web-based user interface for Project Jupyter.

- JupyterLab enables you to work with documents and activities such as Jupyter notebooks, text editors, terminals, and custom components in a flexible, integrated, and extensible manner.

- You can arrange multiple documents and activities side by side in the work area using tabs and splitters.

- `Code Consoles` provide transient scratchpads for running code interactively, with full support for rich output. A code console can be linked to a notebook kernel as a computation log from the notebook, for example.

- `Kernel-backed` documents enable code in any text file (Markdown, Python, R, LaTeX, etc.) to be run interactively in any Jupyter kernel.


## Numpy Tutorial: Data Analysis with Python

- `NumPy` is a commonly used Python data analysis package. By using NumPy, you can speed up your workflow, and interface with other packages in the Python ecosystem.

### Lists Of Lists for CSV Data

- Using the csv.reader object, which will allow us to read in and split up all the content from the ssv file.

### Numpy 2-Dimensional Arrays

- A 2-dimensional array is also known as a matrix, and is something you should be familiar with. In fact, itâ€™s just a different way of thinking about a list of lists.

### Creating A NumPy Array

- Using the numpy.array function. If we pass in a list of lists, it will automatically create a NumPy array with the same number of rows and columns.

### NumPy Data Types

- Each NumPy array can store elements of a single data type.

- NumPy stores values using its own data types, which are distinct from Python types.

### NumPy Array Operations

- NumPy makes it simple to perform mathematical operations on arrays. This is one of the primary advantages of NumPy, and makes it quite easy to do computations.
