### Linear Progression with scikit-learn

#### Scikit-learn

- Scikit-learn is a powerful Python module for machine learning. It contains function for regression, classification, clustering, model selection and dimensionality reduction.

- The first step/steps:
1. import numpy as np
2. import pandas as pd
3. import scipty.stats as stats
4. import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
5. import sklearn

#### What is Linear Regression

- Linear regression is a basic and commonly used type of predictive analysis.  The overall idea of regression is to examine two things: (1) does a set of predictor variables do a good job in predicting an outcome (dependent) variable?  (2) Which variables in particular are significant predictors of the outcome variable, and in what way do they–indicated by the magnitude and sign of the beta estimates–impact the outcome variable?
