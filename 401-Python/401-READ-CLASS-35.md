## GRAPHS

- A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges.

### Common Terminology

1. Vertex - A vertex, also called a “node”, is a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices.

3. Edge - An edge is a connection between two nodes.

2. Neighbor - The neighbors of a node are its adjacent nodes, i.e., are connected via an edge.

4. Degree - The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to that vertex.

### Directed vs Undirected

- An `Undirected Graph` is a graph where each edge is undirected or bi-directional. This means that the undirected graph does not move in any direction.

- A `Directed Graph` also called a Digraph is a graph where every edge is directed.

- Unlike an undirected graph, a Digraph has direction. Each node is directed at another node with a specific requirement of what node should be referenced next.

### Complete vs Connected vs Disconnected

- A `complete graph` is when all nodes are connected to all other nodes.

- A `connected graph` is graph that has all of vertices/nodes have at least one edge.

- A `disconnected graph` is a graph where some vertices may not have edges.
