# READ CLASS 18 CRYPTOGRAPHY

### Encryption, decryption, and cracking

- One of the earliest encryption techniques is the Caesar Cipher, invented by Julius Caesar more than two thousand years ago to communicate messages to his allies.

### Decrypting a message

- According to historical records, Caesar always used a shift of 3. As long as his message recipient knew the shift amount, it was trivial for them to decode the message.

### Frequency analysis

- Human languages tend to use some letters more than others. For example, "E" is the most popular letter in the English language. We can analyze the frequency of the characters in the message and identify the most likely "E" and narrow down the possible shift amounts based on that.

### Keywords

- Encryption: scrambling the data according to a secret key (in this case, the alphabet shift).

- Decryption: recovering the original data from scrambled data by using the secret key.

- Code cracking: uncovering the original data without knowing the secret, by using a variety of clever techniques.
