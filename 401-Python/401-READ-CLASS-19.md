## Python Regular Expression Tutorial

- Regular Expressions, often shortened as regex, are a sequence of characters used to check whether a pattern exists in a given text (string) or not.


- `.`	- A period. Matches any single character except the newline character.

- `^`	- A caret. Matches a pattern at the start of the string.

- `\A`- Uppercase A. Matches only at the start of the string.

- `$`	- Dollar sign. Matches the end of the string.

- `\Z`- Uppercase Z. Matches only at the end of the string.

- `[ ]`- Matches the set of characters you specify within it.

- `\`	- If the character following the backslash is a recognized escape character, then the special meaning of the term is taken.
- ∙ Else the backslash () is treated like any other character and passed through.
- ∙ It can be used in front of all the metacharacters to remove their special meaning.

- `\w`- Lowercase w. Matches any single letter, digit, or underscore.

- `\W`- Uppercase W. Matches any character not part of \w (lowercase w).

- `\s`- Lowercase s. Matches a single whitespace character like: space, newline, tab, return.

- `\S`- Uppercase S. Matches any character not part of \s (lowercase s).

- `\d`- Lowercase d. Matches decimal digit 0-9.

- `\D`- Uppercase D. Matches any character that is not a decimal digit.

- `\t`- Lowercase t. Matches tab.

- `\n`- Lowercase n. Matches newline.

- `\r`- Lowercase r. Matches return.

- `\b`- Lowercase b. Matches only the beginning or end of the word.

- `+`- Checks if the preceding character appears one or more times.

- `*`- Checks if the preceding character appears zero or more times.

- ``?`- Checks if the preceding character appears exactly zero or one time.

- `∙`- Specifies a non-greedy version of +, *

- `{ }`- Checks for an explicit number of times.

- `( )`- Creates a group when performing matches.

- `< >`- Creates a named group when performing matches.

## shutil — High-level File Operations

- The shutil module includes high-level file operations such as copying and archiving.

`copyfile()` copies the contents of the source to the destination and raises IOError if it does not have permission to write to the destination file.
