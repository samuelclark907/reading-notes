## Deploying Nexxt App

- Vercel is an all-in-one platform with Global CDN supporting static & JAMstack deployment and Serverless Functions. We believe Vercel is the optimal place to deploy Next.js apps.

- Vercel is made by the creators of Next.js and has first-class support for Next.js. When you deploy your Next.js app to Vercel, the following happens by default:

- Pages that use Static Generation and assets (JS, CSS, images, fonts, etc) will automatically be served from the Vercel Edge Network, which is blazingly fast.

- Pages that use Server-Side Rendering and API routes will automatically become isolated Serverless Functions. This allows page rendering and API requests to scale infinitely.
