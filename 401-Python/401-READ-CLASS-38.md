## React

- Conditional rendering in React works the same way conditions work in JavaScript. Use JavaScript operators like if or the conditional operator to create elements representing the current state, and let React update the UI to match them.

- HTML form elements work a little bit differently from other DOM elements in React, because form elements naturally keep some internal state.

- Often, several components need to reflect the same changing data. We recommend lifting the shared state up to their closest common ancestor.

- React has a powerful composition model, and we recommend using composition instead of inheritance to reuse code between components.

- One of the many great parts of React is how it makes you think about apps as you build them.
