## TREES

- `Node` - A node is the individual item/data that makes up the data structure
- `Root` - The root is the first/top Node in the tree
- `Left Child` - The node that is positioned to the left of a root or node
- `Right Child` - The node that is positioned to the right of a root or node
- `Edge` - The edge in a tree is the link between a parent and child node
- `Leaf` - A leaf is a node that does not contain any children
- `Height` - The height of a tree is determined by the number of edges from the root to the bottommost node

### Traversals

#### Depth First

- Depth first traversal is where we prioritize going through the depth (height) of the tree first.

#### Breadth First

- Breadth first traversal iterates through the tree by going through each level of the tree node-by-node. So, given our starting tree one more time.

#### Binary Trees

- Trees can have any number of children per node, but Binary Trees restrict the number of children to two (hence our left and right children).

- There is no specific sorting order for a binary tree. Nodes can be added into a binary tree wherever space allows.

#### Binary Search Trees

- A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a type of tree that does have some structure attached to it. In a BST, nodes are organized in a manner where all values that are smaller than the root are placed to the left, and all values that are larger than the root are placed to the right.
