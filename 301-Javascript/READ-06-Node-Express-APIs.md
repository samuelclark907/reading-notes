## What is Node.js

- Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.

### V8 Engine

- An open-source JavaScript engine that runs in Google Chrome and other Chromium-based web browsers.

- Responsible for compiling JavaScript directly to native machine code that your computer can execute.

### npm the JavaScript Package Manager

- Node comes bundled with a package manager called npm.

- npm is also the world’s largest software registry.

### How to install a Package Globally

- `npm install -g 'package'`

### Installing a Package Locally

- `npm 'package' -y`

## The Node.js Execution Model

- Single-threaded. It’s also event-driven, which means that everything that happens in Node is in reaction to an event.

- Node’s execution model causes the server very little overhead, and consequently it’s capable of handling a large number of simultaneous connections.

## Advantages of Node.js

- You can do everything in the same language.

- It's faster and better scalability.

- It speaks JSON. JSON is probably the most important data exchange format on the Web
